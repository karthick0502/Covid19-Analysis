# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This repository contains a comprehensive tutorial on data visualization using Matplotlib in Python. Matplotlib is a powerful library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In this tutorial, we cover various aspects of Matplotlib, including:

- Creating and customizing plots
- Working with bar charts, pie charts, and stack plots
- Filling areas on line plots
- Histograms for data distribution analysis
- Scatter plots for visualizing relationships between variables
- Time series data visualization and plotting dates
- Real-time plotting for dynamic data visualization
- Subplots to create multiple plots in a single figure

## Contents

1. **Introduction to Matplotlib**: Getting started with Matplotlib and understanding its basic concepts.

2. **Creating and Customizing Plots**: Exploring different plot styles, customizing plot appearance, and adding legends, titles, and labels.

3. **Bar Charts and Analyzing Data**: Using bar charts to visualize categorical data and analyze survey results.

4. **Pie Charts and Stack Plots**: Creating pie charts to represent data distribution and stack plots for cumulative data visualization.

5. **Filling Areas on Line Plots**: Demonstrating how to fill areas under and between lines on line plots.

6. **Histograms**: Understanding histograms and their usage for analyzing the distribution of numerical data.

7. **Scatter Plots**: Visualizing relationships between variables using scatter plots.

8. **Time Series Data and Plotting Dates**: Handling time series data and plotting dates on the x-axis.

9. **Real-Time Plotting**: Implementing real-time plotting for dynamic data visualization.

10. **Subplots**: Creating multiple plots within a single figure using subplots.
